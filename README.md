# Maps-and-Machine-Learning-(MML)
---- My devotion to maps (of all kinds) and my map-inspired ML project on optimsation algorithms and statistics, applicable for maths, physics and quant finance! Huge fan of navigation data here :-) ----

Hello! I am dedicating this repo “maps” to collect thoughts and inspirations about maps. More specifically - how digital maps recreate real-life routes with accuracy and finding the best path to reaching a destination. 

I am writing this as I’m travelling through Parek and Pahang states, crossing from Ipoh, up to the mountains of the Cameron highlands region, then across rhe mountains into Pahang.

I am especially intrigued by the province flags in Malaysia. The penang flag is very representative: being yellow, white and blue in color, with the iconic coconut tree at the middle, presenting the state as a coastal, tropical region of Malaysia. Less colourful flags as such the Parek flag colored in white, yellow and black, as well as the monotonic black white flag of Pahang, intrigues me even more due to their simplicity yet representative impressions of the two regions: inland, multi-terrain (plateau, highland), populated with dense rainforests.

The mapping of such regions ranges from complex road networks in inland, relatively flatter lands of Parek, which are popular and reasonable locations for largely inhabited cities ; to, less densely populated, steep, mountainous regions in the highland regions of Pahang. I am fascinated by modern mapping technologies that accurately records complex traffic networks, to deciding the best route for travellers like me to exit touristy regions in the fastest, fuel-efficient, cost-effective way that avoids heavy tolls.

In the following, I will begin by exploring the fundamental mathematics and philosophy behind maps, then onto modern computational techniques that transform paper form, 2D maps into digital navigation tools of our everyday use. I am extending this exploration to my own project working on optimisation techniques inspired by maps, into topics of optimisation algorithms in maths & computing, physics, and quantitative finance.
